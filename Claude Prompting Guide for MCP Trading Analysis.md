## Tips for Effective Claude Prompting

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what aspect of MCP analysis you want Claude to focus on.

2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details about your trading approach, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

3. **Share Complete Data**: Make sure to include the entire analysis file rather than just excerpts.

4. **Ask for Reasoning**: Request that Claude explains the logic behind its analysis and recommendations.

5. **Iterate**: If Claude's initial response doesn't fully address your needs, refine your prompt and ask follow-up questions.

6. **Request Visualization Guidance**: Claude can provide code for creating visualizations of your MCP data.

7. **Ask for Comparisons**: Have Claude compare different symbols or timeframes to identify the strongest opportunities.

## Example Workflow

1. Run the MCP analysis script to generate data files
2. Select the appropriate prompt template from this guide
3. Copy the content of your analysis file into the prompt
4. Submit the prompt to Claude for Mac
5. Review Claude's analysis and ask follow-up questions as needed
